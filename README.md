# SushiFrcLib

Add a proper README about the contents, purpose, and usage of this repo

Suggestions

- Add JavaDoc comments to stuff

- Be intentional and as specific as possible with declarations, e.g. naming methods, scope/modifiability of variables, etc.

- Not sure what your exact goals are for sushi lib, but it might help to improve it if you think about implementing a more feature full set of classes, i.e. think about how the classes would be used and what features might be wanted that are missing.
